This program helps you find out how many days are in a given month, considering whether it's a leap year. 

Hereâ€™s how it works:

Set Up the Month Dictionary: It starts by creating a dictionary called months, which maps each month (1-12) to its number of days. February is set to 28 days by default, without considering leap years initially.

Get User Input for Month: The program prompts you to enter a month number. It uses a loop to ensure that the input is valid (between 1 and 12). If the input is invalid or not a number, it asks you to try again.

Check for Leap Year: After confirming the month, the program asks if the current year is a leap year. If you answer "yes," it updates February to have 29 days.

Display the Result: Finally, it outputs the number of days in the selected month, showing you the result based on your inputs.
